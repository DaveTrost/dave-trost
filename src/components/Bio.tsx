      <h3>Hi, I'm Dave</h3>
      <div className='Bio'>
        <p>
          I am a full stack engineer and a career-changer. 
          In the past, I worked my way to the top of EDA software engineering. 
          I specialized in circuit design software for radio-frequency semiconductors.
        </p>
        <p>
          I now call the world of full stack software my career home.
          The industry is an area of great opportunity and significant challenge. 
          I bring with me tools of past success: my work ethic, a sharp eye for detail, 
          and a knowledge that no learning curve is too steep.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will judge my own success by the people I help. 
          Customers use the software. I put myself in their shoes and gain their perspective to guide my decisions.
          My teammates and I have a shared work experience. I want to help our work be fun! 
          I strive to bring my full self to the team and to help others do the same. 
          I believe that big accomplishments are the result of great teamwork.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's work together!
